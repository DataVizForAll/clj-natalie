          <h2>The Story</h2>
          <p class="lead">Background</p>

          <p> In exploring factors that impact a student’s journey through the public education system in the Greater Hartford region, it is crucial to examine the makeup of the student body. Specifically, I chose to delve into how many students enrolled in each type of public school are defined as ‘high needs’, in an effort to gain deeper insight into how much impact educational funding has on different student groups. “High needs” students are defined as students who are eligible for free and reduced lunch, students who are english language learners, and students with disabilities. I focused on the 33-town region encompassed by the term ‘Greater Hartford Area’, and the schools that are within this region, in order to provide a more focused frame for approaching this question. 

	When examining how enrollment of students with high needs varies across districts in the Greater Hartford Area, we see stark differences between many district’s total number of students with high needs. 

</p>
          <p class="lead">Terms Used</p>
          <p> Throughout this data story, multiple terms are used to define key concepts. However, some of these terms are specific to this data itself, so definitions of terms are important to overall understanding.
		- Students with High Needs: Students that are any combination of the following: English Language Learners, Eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch Plans, or Students with Disabilities
		- Greater Hartford Area: For the purpose of this exploration, this area encompasses a 33-town area and its corresponding 33 school districts. Non-geographically based districts are not included in this data story. The 33 towns are as follows: Avon, Berlin, Bloomfield, Bolton, Canton, Coventry, Cromwell, East Granby, East Hartford, East Windsor, Ellington, Enfield, Farmington, Glastonbury, Granby, Hartford, Manchester, New Britain, Newington, Plainville, Portland, Rocky Hill, Simsbury, Somers, South Windsor, Southington, Suffield, Tolland, Vernon, West Hartford, Wethersfield, Windsor, and Windsor Locks. 
          </p>
         <p class="lead">What does the geography of where Students with High Needs are located show us?</p> 
		<p> In order to contextualize this question, I first used data from <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Students/Enrollment-Dashboard?language=en_US">EdSight</a> that I used to show the percentage of high needs students in each district, over the course of the 2021-2022 school year. The lighter areas represent districts where lower numbers of students with high needs are enrolled, and the color deepens as a district has a greater percentage of students with high needs. These percentages come from the amount of students with high needs out of the total number of students enrolled, per each district, so that each percentage represents a number scaled appropriately for the size of the district.
<p>
        <iframe title="Amount of students with high needs differs greatly by district." aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-R42nc" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/R42nc/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="741" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
	<p>As can be seen in Fig. 1 above, this map shows us that there is both a wide variance in percentages, and helps us contextualize a further dive into the trends that are present in Fig. 2. Additionally, with this map view of the data, it’s clear to see that there doesn’t appear to be a correlation between areas that are major population centers and the amount of students with high needs that are enrolled in those districts. 
		</p>
<p> 
<iframe title="In 2021-22, Hartford had nearly 4.5 times the amount of students with high needs as Somers did." aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-uaFCk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uaFCk/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="942" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
	<p> In this chart, which was also assembled using student enrollment data from <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Students/Enrollment-Dashboard?language=en_US">EdSight</a>, we can see that the district with the highest percentage of students with high needs, Hartford, has nearly 4.5 times the amount that the district with the lowest percentage, Somers, has. This reinforces the idea that even within a relatively small-sized geographic area, there exists large disparities in where students with high needs are enrolled in schools. </p>
